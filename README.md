# Basic Face Detection with MobileNet CNN

I wanted to learn about different algorithms to make object recognition for a university project so I used TensorFlow and other technologies to make a face recognition algorithm and see if it's possible to implement that on a RPi 4.

## Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AloisCRR/face-detection-mobilenet.git
   ```

2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

3. Upload the file `face_detection_MobileNet.ipynb`

4. Once notebook is loaded, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F9</kbd> or `Runtime > Run all` to get all the data and test the results.
